#complete algorithm and procedures of that project

1.	Preprocess the image: 
Load and preprocess the soccer field image, including resizing, grayscale conversion, or any other necessary enhancements.
Using Image segmentin remove non playing part of the image of soccer field.

2.	Detect lines using the Hough transform: 
Apply the Hough transform algorithm to detect lines in the image, as described previously.

3.	Filter and refine lines:
Filter out irrelevant lines based on criteria such as angle, length, or position relative to the image, as mentioned earlier.

4.	Identify field boundary lines:
Group the lines that represent the soccer field boundaries together to form a quadrilateral shape.

5.	Find intersection points: 
Determine the intersection points between the boundary lines by solving the mathematical equations of intersecting lines.

6.	Validate and refine the points: 
Validate the intersection points to ensure they correspond to the corners of the soccer field. 
Perform checks such as the ratio of the sides of the quadrilateral or the angles between the lines to verify the correctness of the points. 
Refine the points if necessary by adjusting filtering criteria or applying additional geometric analysis.

7.	Apply homography: 
Use the detected intersection points to compute a homography transformation. 
The homography matrix maps the points from the distorted soccer field image to the corresponding points in a flat, 
top-down view of the field. This transformation helps rectify the perspective distortion and provides a bird's-eye view of the field.


8.	Transform the image: 
Apply the computed homography matrix to warp the image and obtain the rectified output. 
This transformation aligns the soccer field and removes the perspective distortion, giving you a view similar to looking down at the field from above.


9.	Visualize the rectified output: 
Display the rectified image, showcasing the soccer field in a top-down view without the perspective distortion. 
Overlay the detected field boundaries and intersection points on the rectified image to verify the accuracy of the detection.

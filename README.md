Soccer field detection using the Hough Line Transform combines image preprocessing, edge detection, 
Hough transform, and post-processing techniques to automatically extract the lines that define a soccer field from a given image. 
It enables the automated analysis of soccer-related data and facilitates applications ranging from sports analysis to robotic navigation and augmented reality experiences.
